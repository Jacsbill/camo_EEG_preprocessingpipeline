4. FOLDER CONTENTS 

---------------------------------- 

 

STUDY_INFO_main.m contains variable parameters for running pre processing pipeline.  

 

The remaining files should be run in order and will need adapting depending on laptop set up and EEGlab / matlab version etc. 

  

Details of the processing pipeline can be found in the pipline files and associated publication.  

  

Stages 9 and 10 refer to 1hz data preprocessing for spectral analysis which was not used in this study, and therefore is not included. These are not missing files
